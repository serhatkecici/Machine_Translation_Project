    "1. I included puctuations in the model as an extra work. I see that my model can handle punctuations as I hoped for. That was good news for me. \n",
    "2. Again as an extra modification, I seperated the (l' , j' , n') as distinct words. I see that my model can handle \"l'\" as seperate words as in \"new jersey est parfois calme pendant l' automne , et il est neigeux en avril .\" prediction. That was something else I hoped to work, it was nice to see that. \n",
    "3. In the embedding model, I tried mask_zero = True in the embedding layer and hoped that the PAD word will be considered as a distinct dimension in the embedding and this will help the prediction accuract. But it did not worked as I hoped, it removed PADs from the predictions where predictions repeated the last word of the sentence as some kind of a padding strategy. This did not looked nice of course, I removed that parameter. \n",
    "4. The greatest question in my mind: as instructed in the notebook I gave the model sentences as sequences of integers where each integer refers to a word. But this looks like time series prediction and treats words as ordinal items which is not truein real life. Shouldn't we convert them to one-hot-encodings? Or does Keras handle that within modelling? I would be really happy if the reviewer could enlighten me on that:) "
